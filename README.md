# Predicting On Base

For decades, baseball executives treated batting average as the ultimate measure of a hitter's worth, reasoning that true offensive value came from putting the ball in play and piling up hits. "I'm looking for hitters, not walkers" was a frequent refrain in front offices, reflecting the belief that contact and base hits far outweighed drawing walks.

While a single does hold slightly more value than a walk in terms of run expectancy—primarily because it can advance or score runners—batting average was historically overemphasized. In reality, with no runners on base, a single produces no RBIs, just like a walk. In today's game, where pitchers throw harder than ever with elite spin and movement, consistently stringing together hits has become increasingly difficult, further highlighting the limitations of relying too heavily on batting average as the primary gauge of offensive skill.

Let's take a deeper look in how to predict the statistic!
